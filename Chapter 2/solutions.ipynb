    "    Among all the selected models, it is clear that Model 3 is overfitting. One reason for this is that the model tries to fit every data point, regardless of the weight and differences.\n",
    "    Another reason I believe this model is overfitting could be due to the small size of the dataset and the presence of unclean data, which contains a lot of noise.\n",
    "    Additional factors  i think might be contributing to overfitting include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    High Model Complexity\n",
    "    Lack of Regularization\n",
    "    Insufficient Cross-Validation\n",
    "    Excessive Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 4\n",
    "\n",
    "    In my opinion, Model 4 is underfitting. The reason for this is that, according to the image, Model 4 tends to have high bias, which makes it very difficult to learn the training dataset. This will inevitably lead to poor performance on both the training and testing data. For example, when I increase the dataset size, the inaccuracy will increase as well. So, in full scope, based on the PDF image, I can say that Model 4 has high bias and low variance.\n",
